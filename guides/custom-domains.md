# How to use custom domains


1. Add `baby-yoda-verification=DISCORD_USERNAME` as a TXT record.
2. Add a CNAME for whatever you want to point to `dns.baby-yoda.xyz`
3. Switch out places you use baby-yoda.xyz to whatever your chosen domain.
4. Let David know on Discord (aboutdavid#0001) about your custom domain and I'll add it
